# API change history

This file describes notable changes, starting with version 1.0.0.

## 1.0.0 (June 8, 2023)

- API now uses [lodash](https://lodash.com/). It's because I was experimenting with it.
- API now has simple configuration to toggle between dev, staging and prod states. Try ```STAGE=production npm run dev```, it should change port to 5000. 
- Try [this NodeJs course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js-v2/), I love it, and the instructor is really good.
