# Welcome 

Hey, this is a simple API!

# Dependencies

You will need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en)
 and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.\
 Before installing, a usefull tool to manage node versions would be ***[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)***. 

 A database is also needed. In this project i am using [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/), but any other database can work with minor modifications.
 
 Finaly, you might want to use a Virtual Environment to manage you development servers, databases and installations, to avoid polluting you native machine. Hosting different versions of stuff, on top of having various projects, can be hard to manage. Check out [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

# Quick Start

Install node packages:
```bash
npm install
```
Please create a ```.env``` file to the root folder, and configure it as follows, ***according to your database***.
```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://events_api_user:password@localhost/events_api"

JWT_SECRET="cookies"
```

This project uses a JSON-like language to make schemas for the database. The Prisma ORM will also take care of migrations and other cool stuff. To get started:
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

To run the application in dev mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can check the server at\
[http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)\
or visit the docs/client here [http://localhost:3001/api-docs/](http://localhost:3001/api-docs/).

***Note:***\
While trying to authenticate with your JWT using Swagger client, you may encounter CORS errors! Unlilkely, but still, here is [another browser addon](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf/related) ðŸ˜„

# Available Tools, Tech Appendix

### Tools
Instead of installing a database management program like MYSQL Workbench, Prisma provides us with one. It is simple but cool. To access it run
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
To debug your API check out this cool [API client for VSCode](https://www.thunderclient.com/) or use [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

# ToDos

>Finish the implementation.

>Add unit testing.

>Finish the Swagger docs 

Currently implemented for Swagger: 
- User Creation
- JWT authentication
- event creation (if you make the same one twice server dies :))
- event deletion

Not cool:
- it has too many leftover schemas and stuff

>Create a seed script for the db.

>Install TsDoc to document the codebase.

>Add a Vagrantfile of an instance that runs a suitable Node environment, turn project into a kind of monorepo.

>Add a changelog.md file to keep track of changes.

> Additional things that could be refined:

- Code in Middlewares and handlers repeats itself, should be turned into functions/methods.

- Swagger can automatically generate Docs by parsing comments on the code, with package "swagger-jsdoc".\
***Keep in mind***, that would not be optimal if code is documentated with TSDoc,
and would need further consideration.
